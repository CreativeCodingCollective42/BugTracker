# Creative Coding Collective - Bug Tracker

## Why This Exists

As creative developers, we've all been there: you find a critical bug, report it to Adobe/Microsoft..., and then... silence. Or worse, they close it as "won't fix" or "by design." Meanwhile, you're stuck with a broken workflow and no official record of the issue.

Our collective bug tracker serves as a persistent, community-owned record of the issues that actually impact creative developers. We document bugs here first, then submit polished reports to vendors with a reference back to our discussion.

## What We Track

- **Adobe Creative Cloud** (InDesign, Illustrator, After Effects, Photoshop, etc.)
- **ExtendScript, UXP, CEP** and related APIs
- **Microsoft Office** integration issues
- **Cross-platform** development problems
- **Third-party tools** that affect creative workflows

## How It Works

### 1. Report Here First
Create an issue in this repository using our templates. Don't worry about having all the details perfect - we'll help you refine it.

### 2. Community Collaboration
Other developers can:
- Confirm they're seeing the same issue
- Provide additional reproduction steps
- Share workarounds and solutions
- Add context about impact on real projects

### 3. Submit to Vendors
Once we have a solid, community-validated report, submit it to the appropriate vendor tracker:
- **Adobe:** [Adobe Bug Report](https://www.adobe.com/products/wishform.html)
- **Microsoft:** [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/)

Make sure the bug report has a reference to the issue number in this bug tracker (e.g. add something like CCC#123).

- Update the issue our end with the external ticket number

### 4. Track and Follow Up
Keep our issue updated with vendor responses, status changes, and any new developments. Even if the vendor closes their ticket, ours stays open for continued discussion.

## Issue Templates

Choose the appropriate template when creating a new issue:

- **Adobe Bug Report** - For Creative Cloud applications and APIs
- **Microsoft Bug Report** - For Office integration and Windows issues  
- **Cross-Platform Bug** - For issues affecting multiple platforms
- **API/SDK Bug** - For ExtendScript, UXP, CEP, or other development APIs
- **General Bug Report** - For everything else

## Submission Guidelines

### Before You Submit
- **Search existing issues** - Your bug might already be reported
- **Try to reproduce** - Include clear steps others can follow. Try to remove any irrelevant details and provide a simple process to reproduce the bug.
- **Check multiple versions** - Is this new or long-standing?
- **Consider impact** - How does this affect real projects?

### Writing Good Reports
- **Be specific** - "Script crashes" vs "ExtendScript crashes on line 45 when accessing document.pages[0].textFrames"
- **Include versions** - Platform, App version, OS, SDK version, etc.
- **Show your work** - Code samples, screenshots, error messages
- **Describe impact** - How does this affect your actual work?

### What Makes a Great Bug Report
1. **Clear title** that summarizes the issue
2. **Minimal reproduction case** - simplest way to trigger the bug
3. **Expected vs actual behavior** - what should happen vs what does happen
4. **Environment details** - versions, OS, configuration
5. **Business impact** - why this matters to real projects

## Community Guidelines

### Commenting on Issues
- **Add value** - New information, confirmation, workarounds
- **Stay constructive** - Focus on solving problems, not venting
- **Be specific** - "Me too" comments aren't helpful without details
- **Share solutions** - Found a workaround? Share it!

### Vendor Interaction
- **Be professional** when referencing our tracker in vendor reports
- **Don't spam** vendors with duplicate reports from multiple community members
- **Share responses** - If a vendor responds to you directly, update our issue
